# fraud-detection-system
detect fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning models. The system will be trained on publicly available transaction datasets to recognize patterns of fraud.

# Financial Fraud Detection System

This project aims to build a machine learning-based system for detecting fraudulent financial transactions. The system uses publicly available datasets to train models and identify transactions that are likely to be fraudulent.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-system.git
bash```
2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd fraud-detection-system
```
3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data
The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. You can download it from here. Place the dataset in the data/ directory.

## Usage
1. To run the data analysis notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb

2. To train the model:

```bash
python src/model.py

3. To evaluate the model:

```bash
python src/evaluation.py

Model Evaluation
The model’s performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC-AUC
These metrics are critical for identifying fraudulent transactions, given the imbalance in the dataset.
